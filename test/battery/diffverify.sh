#
# The baseline is CUT, not committed: it comes from the binary
# `test/battery/BASE` pins, cached under target/battery/base/<sha>/.
# The row was first baselined at commit bd1d648849 -- B15-2, the P0 prelude, which is the
# rev every B15 oracle baselines against.  It is the *pre-rewrite*
# behaviour of diff.rs and the six xdiff/ files: neither has been touched
# yet, which is the whole point of standing this oracle up first.
# Regenerate ONLY when a behaviour change is *intended* and reviewed -- and
# regeneration is now a BASE BUMP, not a re-cut in place.  Write the new
# commit into `test/battery/BASE`, in a commit of its own whose body says
# what moved; the cache under target/battery/base/ is keyed by that sha, so
# every row re-cuts itself against the new binary on the next run.  See
# README.md.
#
# All three artifacts are compared, stderr included: nvim's own messages
# go to the prompt, which in a headless process is stderr, and s90 is the
# only place the E96/E97/E99/E100/E101/E102/E474/E816/E1549 arms and the
# ':diffget with report=0' message path are visible at all.  The report's
# final `exit N` line is the hang/crash assertion -- 124 is the harness
# timeout and 134 an abort.
#
# THIS SWEEP DEPENDS ON THE HOST'S diff(1) AND patch(1).  s10 and s12
# shell out to them (the driver symlinks whatever is on the caller's PATH
# into $WORK/bin).  Upgrading diffutils or patch on this machine will
# move those two sections' artifacts without a line of nvim changing;
# `x10 have-diff 1` / `P12 have-patch 1` at the top of each section is
# the tell that they ran at all.
#
# When a slice *adds* cases, land the additions against unchanged
# behaviour first (0 removed lines, N added, which is itself the proof
# that they are pure), re-baseline, and only then land the behaviour
# change -- so that the second delta is nothing but the behaviour.
