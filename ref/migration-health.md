# Migration Health & Known Regressions

This file tracks correctness regressions discovered in the Rust-migration branch
and the process gaps that let them accumulate. It is a roadmap for fix waves.
Keep it updated as regressions are fixed (strike through / remove) or found.

## CRITICAL PROCESS GAP — `just check` does not run the functional suite

`just check` = `build + smoke-test + rust-check`. It runs the Rust *unit* tests
(`cargo nextest` on pure crates) and three `.vim` smoke files — but it does **NOT**
run Neovim's C/Lua **functional test suite** (`functionaltest`). The "4339 tests
pass" that executors cite are Rust-only unit tests. As a result, broken VimL
builtins and crashes in core paths have been merged repeatedly without detection.

**The functional suite DOES work here and is fast per-spec.** Run a targeted spec:

```bash
TEST_FILE=test/functional/vimscript/writefile_spec.lua \
  timeout -s 9 580 cmake --build build --target functionaltest
```

`TEST_FILE` may be a single spec or a directory. Also supports `TEST_FILTER`,
`TEST_TAG`, `TEST_FILTER_OUT` (see `cmake/RunTests.cmake`).

**Recommendation:** every migration/fix wave that touches a builtin or eval path
should run the relevant functional spec(s), not just `just check`. Consider adding
a `just functionaltest-vimscript` recipe and running it before claiming a wave green.

## Regression-guard smoke tests added (partial mitigation)

Wired into `just smoke-test` (so `just check` now covers them):
- `test/regexp_smoke.vim` — regexp (29 cases)
- `test/throw_smoke.vim` — exception throw from inside functions (4 cases) [Wave 70]
- `test/type_smoke.vim` — VarType-constant-sensitive builtins (22 cases) [Wave 71]

## Fixed regressions

- **[Wave 70] P0 SIGSEGV: throw from inside a function.** 3-way infinite recursion
  `get_scriptname` (runtime.c) → `rs_get_scriptname` (never-implemented trampoline)
  → `nvim_rt_get_scriptname` (runtime_ffi.c) → … Introduced by commit `7f4f9ecf9a`
  (a relocate-not-port that created a cycle). Fixed by genuinely porting the SID
  switch into Rust + deleting the trampoline. Commits `d477d29d64`, `61fe2e1241`.
- **[Wave 71] 13 wrong VarType constants across 10 files.** Per-file local copies of
  the VarType enum with wrong literals (e.g. fs.rs `VAR_STRING=6`, `VAR_LIST=5`).
  Broke `chdir`, `writefile([list])`, and others. Fixed by importing canonical
  constants / adding compile-time guards. Commits `795f4403ef`, `a8ffac30c8`,
  `e4d6b49f15`.

## OPEN functional-suite failures — AUTHORITATIVE TRIAGE (2026-06-08)

Two independent full triage passes (vimscript + api fully per-spec; core mostly;
other dirs sampled) CORROBORATE the clusters below. The migration has pervasive,
severe functional regressions invisible to `just check`. Fix-wave order is by
leverage (a single root cause often clears a whole spec). Per-spec logs were saved
under `/tmp/triage/` during the run (may be gone after reboot — re-run as needed).

**Reproduce any spec:** `TEST_FILE=test/functional/<path>_spec.lua timeout -s 9 560 cmake --build build --target functionaltest 2>&1 | tail -n 80`

### Cluster A — `b:` / buffer-var → E908 "Using an invalid value as a String" [HIGH, clean]
`getbufvar()`/`setbufvar()` and `b:changedtick` access wrongly raise E908 on valid
input. Clears TWO specs. Likely wrong VarType/typval string-coercion in the migrated
`vars` crate. Source leads: `src/nvim-rs/vars/src/viml_funcs.rs` (getbufvar/setbufvar),
b:changedtick dict population.
- `vimscript/buf_functions_spec.lua` (5 FAIL + 6 ERR), `vimscript/changedtick_spec.lua` (8 ERR).

### Cluster B — quickfix arg-type validation emits wrong error code [HIGH, clean]
`setqflist()`/`setloclist()` raise E731/E928 where E928/E715 expected (and vice-versa).
Source confirmed: `src/nvim-rs/quickfix/src/api.rs:~2003`.
- `vimscript/errorlist_spec.lua` (also HANGS, see D), `api/vim_spec.lua` nvim_call_function.

### Cluster C — JSON/msgpack codec CRASHES nvim ("EOF received") [CRITICAL]
`json_decode(list)` and `msgpackparse(systemlist(...))` hard-crash nvim; `json_encode`
returns '' / wrong. One crash poisons 60+ tests via EOF cascade. Source:
`src/nvim-rs/eval_codec/{decode,encode,json}.rs`.
- `vimscript/json_functions_spec.lua` (10F + 62E), `vimscript/msgpack_functions_spec.lua` (3F + 11E).

### Cluster D — HANGS / deadlocks (cmdwin · textlock · insert-completion · feedkeys) [CRITICAL]
A spec that hangs loses ALL its remaining tests and blocks whole-directory runs.
Strong shared sub-theme: **cmdwin + textlock guards**, and key-feeding that waits for
input that never arrives. Confirmed hangs: `errorlist`(setloclist window-close #13721),
`map_functions`(mapset replace_keycodes), `null`(complete()), `setpos`(at startup),
`system`(mid-suite), core/`fileio`(symlink backup #11349), core/`path`(gf multibyte #20517),
core/`remote`; api/`tabpage`(set_win when textlocked/cmdwin), api/`window`(set_buf in cmdwin),
api/`buffer`(E315), api/`extmark`(undo #25147), api/`keymap`(nowait), api/`vim`(nvim_paste insert),
editor/`completion`(v:completed_item), editor/`count`(v:count in cmdwin). Whole dirs that
hang on an early spec: editor, options, lua, ui, autocmd, ex_cmds, shada, treesitter,
plugin, terminal, legacy, provider. **Fixing the cmdwin/textlock deadlock likely clears several at once.**

### Cluster E — keymap dict serialization round-trip mismatch [MEDIUM, single root]
`nvim_get_keymap`/`nvim_set_keymap` round-trip returns a structurally different dict
(~23 "Expected objects to be the same" in `api/keymap_spec.lua`). One fix → ~20 tests.

### Cluster F — cursor/pos API rejects valid [row,col] [MEDIUM, clean]
`Argument "pos" must be a [row, col] array` on valid input. `api/buffer_spec.lua` (6E),
`vimscript/api_functions_spec.lua` eval-API.

### Cluster G — Lua function marshalling [MEDIUM]
`nvim_eval`/`nvim_call_function` return a Lua function as a string, not callable.
`api/vim_spec.lua` ("can return Lua function to Lua code").

### Cluster H — misc eval/ex-command (likely VarType family, shares A) [MEDIUM]
`let_spec`(:let listing curly/subscript vars CRASH), `match_functions`(setmatches CRASH),
`ctx_functions`(ctxpush/pop/get/set round-trip + buffer-list CRASH), editor/`ctrl_c`(:global E323),
editor/`fold`(:fold filter E493), api/`autocmd`(lambda E117 / augroup delete CRASH).

### Cluster I — startup / Ex-mode / stdin-tty [MEDIUM]
`core/startup`(10F+19E: stdin/pipe, ttyin/ttyout, -es/-Es, exrc), `core/main`(-s, Ex-mode),
`core/exit`(:cquit redir, v:exiting try-catch).

### Likely test-env artifacts (verify, de-prioritize)
Screen/redraw diff failures: `input_spec`(17F highlight), `screenchar_spec`(floating),
`timer`, `execute`, api/`ui`, editor/`defaults` popupmenu — noisy, terminal/timing-sensitive.
`system_spec` shell tests (SHELL=sh) and `environ`($HOME E108) partly env-dependent (but the
system_spec HANG is real). `script/` dir PASSES 98/98 → the test runner itself is healthy.

### Recommended fix order
A (E908) → C (codec crash) → D cmdwin/textlock sub-theme → B (quickfix codes) → E/F/G → H/I.

### STATUS (updated 2026-06-08, fix waves in progress)
- **Cluster A — FIXED** (commit 916bdf7d3b): root cause was `TV_SIZE=24` vs real 16 in the
  `vars` crate (argvar stride corruption) + a null-`first` deref in `:let b:` + a msg_row
  clamp. buf_functions 30/30, changedtick 10/10. Guard: test/buf_smoke.vim.
- **Cluster C — FIXED** (commit 2fadb04b26): `tv_list_equal/tv_dict_equal/tv_blob_equal`
  declared `-> c_int` but defined `-> bool` (x86-64 partial-register garbage). json 77/77,
  msgpack 71/71.
- **Cluster B — FIXED** (commit d596ba7ba8): wrong VarType magic numbers (5 vs VAR_STRING=2)
  + NULL deref in setqflist/setloclist. All arg-validation tests green (the T9 hang is D).
- **FFI Class A/B/C signature mismatches — FIXED** (commit 8ac4c7fe1d, 82 files): 59 bool/c_int
  return-type symbols corrected + arena_alloc + operators.rs param. Also fixed **let_spec
  CRASH → 9/9**. See ref/ffi-audit.md. REMAINING: Class D/E param mismatches (~170 sites, MEDIUM).
- **Cluster D — insert/feedkeys sub-theme FIXED** (commit 5e7aed2dc0): `VimState` struct in
  `edit/src/dispatch.rs` had `execute`/`check` fields in the WRONG ORDER vs `state_defs.h` /
  `state/src/lib.rs`. `state_enter` reads by offset, so the check handler was called as the
  execute handler — always returned "continue", spinning at 100% CPU in insert mode and never
  consuming ESC → hang. One-line field-order swap. Unblocks every spec using `insert()` in setup.
  setpos_spec now completes (5 tests, was a 200s hang). Guard: test/insert_smoke.vim.
- **Cluster D — STILL OPEN, cmdwin/textlock sub-theme** (separate deadlock, persists after the
  VimState fix): window (set_buf in cmdwin), tabpage (set_win when textlocked), errorlist T9
  (setloclist window-closed), null T58 (complete() w/ NULL list), map_functions T13 (mapset
  replace_keycodes). Need their own backtrace/root-cause. Re-run whole dirs (editor/lua/ui/etc.)
  now that the insert-spin is gone — many may have been hanging only on the insert() spin.
- **Cluster H — partially open**: let_spec FIXED; ctx_functions still 5 FAIL (register/jumplist/
  buflist round-trip), match_functions 1 FAIL (matchaddpos zero-length) + setmatches was CRASH
  (recheck), editor/ctrl_c/fold, api/autocmd lambda.

## Lessons for executors (anti-patterns observed)

- **Relocate-not-port** (wave 66, and the get_scriptname trampoline): moving C logic
  behind a one-line passthrough — or worse, a passthrough that recurses. Always
  verify NET C across ALL files AND that the Rust side actually implements logic.
- **Hallucinated per-file constants**: redefining enum values locally with wrong
  numbers. Import from the canonical source (`eval/src/expr/constants.rs`,
  `nvim-typval::VarType`) or add `const _: () = assert!(...)` guards.
- **"4339 tests pass" ≠ correct**: that's Rust unit tests only. Run functional specs.
